create_input_ref_2D.m and create_input_ref_3D.m are matlab scripts that generate input files for NLACE.

They use pre-formatted data (a *.mat file) as described in the readme/README file in
~jfdord/database2D and ~jfdord/database3D folders.
The "london_data" is in folder /bigtmp/jfdord/Backup/london_data/inversions/ (the scripts for the irregular grids are there as well)

The scripts are organized as follows:
- at the beginning: choose the dataset and options needed.
- then select the data and build the topology
- then print the beginning of the input file (all variable parameters)
- add the coordinates of the vertices, then the topology
- proceed with the BCs (some changes can be made there)
- proceed with the datn section
- proceed with the measured data

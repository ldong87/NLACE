	This is the modified elem66.f that is capable of using psi=log(mu/mu_ref), and phi=log(lambda/lambda_ref) as the optimization parameters, instead of mu and lambda. 
You can also use mu and lambda as the optimization parameters with this element. 
A parameter called logflag, allows you to choose what type of optimization variable you use. 
One of the main advantages of using psi and phi as the optimization parameters is that you are able to do a better job avoiding the optimization bounds, leading to faster convergence.

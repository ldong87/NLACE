 #This file helps checking about the convergence of the optimization algorithm
 #    by printing infos related to the values of the objective function and
 #    its components.
 #- Every line describes an iteration of the optimization algorithm,
 #- on every line there are x*2+2+4 real numbers where x equals the number
 #    of measured fields used,
 #- the first 2 numbers on a line are the dataMatch and the forceMatch terms
 #    for the first measurement used,
 #- if x>1, numbers at position 3 and 4 are the dataMatch and the forceMatch
 #    terms for the second measurement
 #- etc...
 #- the following numbers are: the regularization term for each measurement
 #    and the objective function value,
 #- followed by the L2 norms of parameter1, its gradient, parameter2 and its
 #    gradient.
 #note by JFD: gnuplot is convenient to print a column
 #             plot "*.out.cvg" u 3
 #             replot "*.out.cvg" u 6

-Measured data from input file obtained obtained by solving forward problem with elem305 (incompressible element) and adding 3% white Gaussian noise. (see Sevan's folder /users/goenes/inverse_run_tests/April2010/large_inclusion_no_force_information/Noise/3%noise/alpha1.0e-11/)
-Checked with finite difference but not reported here.

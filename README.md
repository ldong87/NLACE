# NLACE
NonLinear Adjoint Coefficients Estimator

NLACE is developed by Assad A. Oberai, Paul Barbone, their students and postdocs. More details about NLACE can be found by examing Prof. Oberai's (https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Oberai/Assad) and/or Prof. Barbone's related publication lists (http://people.bu.edu/barbone/biomech_imaging.html) . NLACE solves practical inverse problems / PDE-constrained optimization problems mainly in the biology-related fields, such as tissue BioMechanical Imaging and cell Traction Force Microscopy, where the former one inverts for tissue properties and the latter inverts for cell surface traction.

NLACE is written in FORTRAN and parallelized in OpenMP.
